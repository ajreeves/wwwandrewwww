## Research Question

How do voters respond to policy changes in Medicaid, particularly in terms of political accountability for governors?

## Main Finding

Governors receive credit or blame for Medicaid expansion decisions. Voters in states that expanded Medicaid were more likely to support incumbent governors, especially when they perceived personal or community benefits.

## Research Design

Difference-in-differences analysis comparing political attitudes and electoral outcomes in Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states before and after policy changes.

## Data Employed

Public opinion surveys and gubernatorial election results, matched with state-level Medicaid expansion decisions and health coverage statistics.

## Substantive Importance

The paper illustrates how major public policy changes translate into electoral accountability, even for policies that are complex and administered at multiple levels of government.

## Research Areas

Public Policy, Electoral Accountability, State Politics, Quantitative Methods, Retrospective Voting
