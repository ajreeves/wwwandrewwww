## Research Question

How do the presence of auto workers and PAC contributions influence congressional support for the auto industry?

## Main Finding

Legislators are more likely to support particularistic legislation benefiting the auto industry when their districts contain more auto workers, but this effect diminishes on broader or more ideologically contested legislation.

## Research Design

The authors analyze roll call votes on major auto-related bills and examine lobbying activity across over 250 pieces of legislation.

## Data Employed

Roll call voting data, auto worker population statistics by congressional district, and lobbying records for bills of interest to the auto industry.

## Substantive Importance

The study highlights the electoral and representational incentives that shape economic policymaking. It shows that legislators respond not only to campaign contributions but to the concentrated presence of industry workers in their districts.

## Research Areas

Legislative Behavior, Interest Groups, Quantitative Methods, Distributive Politics, Electoral Behavior
