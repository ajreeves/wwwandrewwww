## Research Question

How does vulnerability to sea-level rise shape public opinion toward climate change policy?

## Main Finding

People who live in coastal communities vulnerable to sea-level rise are more likely to support climate mitigation policies, particularly if they are deeply rooted in their communities. The effect is not strongest among those with the most to lose financially, but among those most tied to place.

## Research Design

The study uses a multi-method empirical approach combining large-scale survey data with precinct-level voting returns on climate-related propositions.

## Data Employed

Hundreds of thousands of survey responses and nearly 30,000 precinct-level voting returns, matched with local vulnerability to sea-level rise.

## Substantive Importance

The findings suggest that direct exposure to climate threats can overcome partisan divides and build support for policy change. It underscores how community-rooted vulnerabilityâ€“-not just ideology or partisanshipâ€“-shapes public opinion about climate change.

## Research Areas

Public Policy, Public Opinion, Geographic Context, Electoral Behavior, Survey Research
