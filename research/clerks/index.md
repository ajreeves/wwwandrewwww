## Research Question

Does the method of selectionâ€“-appointment vs. electionâ€“-affect how municipal clerks represent their constituents?

## Main Finding

Elected municipal clerks are more responsive to constituents and more oriented toward public service than appointed ones. However, selection method has limited impact on ideological or policy preferences.

## Research Design

Cross-sectional survey with comparisons by selection method, supported by a preregistered research design.

## Data Employed

An original online and mail survey of municipal clerks across five New England states conducted in Spring 2023.

## Substantive Importance

The study informs ongoing debates about electoral accountability and bureaucratic professionalism in local governance. It underscores how institutional design affects democratic responsiveness even in low-salience local offices.

## Research Areas

Local Government, Electoral Accountability, Institutional Design, Democratic Accountability, Survey Research
