## Research Question

How do polling place lines affect voter experience, confidence, and trust in the electoral process?

## Main Finding

Long lines at polling places reduce voter confidence in the fairness and efficiency of elections. These effects are strongest among voters who experience delays and among historically marginalized groups.

## Research Design

Original survey research assessing voter experiences with polling lines and their relationship to confidence in the electoral process.

## Data Employed

Post-election surveys capturing self-reported wait times, demographic information, and evaluations of election administration.

## Substantive Importance

The study demonstrates how seemingly minor administrative barriers like wait times can erode trust in democratic institutions. It provides evidence for reforms aimed at improving access and equity in election administration.

## Research Areas

Election Administration, Electoral Behavior, Survey Research, Democratic Accountability, Field Research
