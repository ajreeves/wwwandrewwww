## Research Question

How does the political context shape public evaluations of presidential power and the use of executive orders?

## Main Finding

Public support for executive orders depends heavily on partisan alignment. When presidents use unilateral tools, co-partisans reward them and out-partisans punish themâ€“-regardless of the issue or justification.

## Research Design

Survey experiments varying the identity of the president, the issue area, and the type of justification given for an executive order.

## Data Employed

Experimental data from large national surveys examining public reaction to hypothetical uses of executive power.

## Substantive Importance

This study shows how partisan polarization shapes not only elite behavior but also mass attitudes toward executive power. It reveals a key mechanism behind the erosion of consensus on constitutional norms.

## Research Areas

Research Methods, Survey Research, Geographic Context, Electoral Geography, Quantitative Methods
