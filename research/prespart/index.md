## Research Question

Do presidents reflect national interests in distributing federal aid, or do they favor their partisan base?

## Main Finding

Presidents disproportionately direct federal aid to counties with co-partisan governors, particularly during election years. This pattern holds across both Democratic and Republican administrations, suggesting a systematic partisan logic in executive resource allocation.

## Research Design

Panel regression models of county-level FEMA disaster aid from 1996 to 2011, with interaction terms capturing the presence of co-partisan governors and electoral timing.

## Data Employed

FEMA public assistance records, gubernatorial partisanship data, county-level political and demographic controls, and presidential election timing.

## Substantive Importance

The findings reveal a hidden form of executive particularism that operates through federal-state cooperation. They suggest presidents use intergovernmental tools to serve political ends, raising concerns about the politicization of emergency management.

## Research Areas

Presidential Particularism, Disaster Politics, Partisanship, Intergovernmental Relations, County-Level Analysis
