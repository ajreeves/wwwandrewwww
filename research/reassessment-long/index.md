## Research Question

How should we assess the effectiveness of the American presidency, and what metrics capture success beyond short-term approval or policy wins?

## Main Finding

The authors argue for a broader reassessment of presidential effectiveness that includes institutional leadership, long-term policy change, and normative considerations. They caution against over-reliance on popularity or legislative tallies as measures of presidential success.

## Research Design

A conceptual and historical reassessment drawing on presidential case studies and existing theories of executive leadership.

## Data Employed

Historical case examples from multiple presidencies, used illustratively to support normative and institutional arguments.

## Substantive Importance

This work encourages scholars and citizens to evaluate presidents in terms of democratic values, institutional stewardship, and enduring impactâ€“-not just short-term wins. It reframes how presidential greatness and failure are understood.

## Research Areas

Campaign Strategy, Presidential Elections, Institutional Design, Normative Theory, Democratic Accountability
