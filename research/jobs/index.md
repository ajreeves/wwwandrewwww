## Research Question

How do constituents respond to presidential efforts to claim credit for local economic gains, particularly job creation?

## Main Finding

Presidents often try to take credit for new jobs, but their success depends on partisan alignment and media coverage. Co-partisans are more likely to believe presidential claims, while out-partisans are skeptical or unaffected.

## Research Design

Survey experiments testing how voters react to job-related presidential credit-claiming messages under varying partisan and economic conditions.

## Data Employed

Nationally representative survey experiments embedded in online panels, paired with local economic indicators and presidential messaging cues.

## Substantive Importance

The study helps explain the limits of presidential influence on public perceptions of the economy, highlighting how partisanship mediates credit and blame in the political information environment.

## Research Areas

Presidential Accountability, Economic Voting, Partisanship, Survey Experiments, Political Communication
