## Research Question

How do public attitudes about government spending on disaster relief change depending on whether the aid is framed as targeted or universal?

## Main Finding

People are more supportive of disaster aid when it is framed as universal and not targeted toward specific groups. This reflects a general preference for broad-based government programs over particularistic ones.

## Research Design

Survey experiments that vary how disaster relief spending is described and identify how framing affects public support.

## Data Employed

Original nationally representative survey experiments with randomized framing of disaster aid policy scenarios.

## Substantive Importance

The findings offer insights into how public opinion can constrain or enable government responsiveness to crises, depending on perceptions of fairness and distributional equity.

## Research Areas

Legislative Behavior, Electoral Behavior, Survey Experiments, Public Opinion, Quantitative Methods
