## Research Question

Does the public prefer presidential action or delegation to commissions when it comes to addressing major policy issues?

## Main Finding

There is no significant difference in public approval between direct presidential action and delegation to a commission. The public also sees no difference in the perceived effectiveness of policies formed through these two avenues.

## Research Design

Four original survey experiments testing public reactions to different forms of presidential action across various issue areas.

## Data Employed

Experimental data from four public opinion surveys fielded to test causal effects of institutional design on public approval.

## Substantive Importance

Challenges the notion that presidential commissions are perceived as more credible or effective. Suggests that presidents can use commissions to appear active without suffering public backlash for inaction.

## Research Areas

Presidential Power, Public Opinion, Survey Experiments, Institutional Design, Democratic Accountability
