## Research Question

How do local crime rates affect public support for policing, punishment, and criminal justice reform?

## Main Finding

Local crime rates influence public opinion in complex ways. Higher violent crime correlates with greater support for punitive measures, but people's personal experience and political predispositions shape how they interpret crime trends.

## Research Design

Cross-sectional survey combined with geographic data on local crime rates, testing how objective conditions relate to subjective attitudes.

## Data Employed

National survey data linked to local-level crime statistics and demographic variables.

## Substantive Importance

The study informs debates about the politics of policing and punishment by showing how geographic context conditions public opinion. It underscores the importance of both place-based and psychological mechanisms in shaping views on criminal justice.

## Research Areas

Presidential Accountability, Public Opinion, Geographic Context, Survey Research, Quantitative Methods
