'access': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do polling place conditions vary across jurisdictions, and what factors account for this variation?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Polling places across the United States in the 2016 election generally exhibited high quality. Variation in polling place access, facilities, and practices was largely a function of county and state-level factors, not voter demographics.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The study used a multi-jurisdictional field assessment of polling places across 26 jurisdictions in 17 states, combining observational data and administrative records.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Data come from in-person evaluations and administrative data collected during the 2016 presidential election. The study builds on prior localized research but scales up to a national analysis.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study provides critical evidence that challenges prior findings of systemic disparities in polling place quality along racial or socioeconomic lines, suggesting institutional rather than demographic sources of variation. This has implications for election policy and equity in access to the vote.</p>',

'caucus': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Who attends Republican House caucus meetings, and what does this tell us about party organization and member incentives?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Members who are party leaders or electorally vulnerable are more likely to attend caucus meetings, while those with seniority or who vote less with their party are less likely to do so. Attendance is driven by the pursuit of private benefits such as information and agenda influence.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A mixed-methods approach combining elite interviews and original quantitative data on attendance records from 2007–2013.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Interviews with Republican members and staffers, along with unique administrative data on weekly caucus attendance.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study reveals how internal party institutions distribute influence and resources, especially away from the public eye. It highlights how party cohesion and internal strategy are reinforced through informal practices like caucus meetings.</p>',

'clerks': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Does the method of selection—appointment vs. election—affect how municipal clerks represent their constituents?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Elected municipal clerks are more responsive to constituents and more oriented toward public service than appointed ones. However, selection method has limited impact on ideological or policy preferences.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Cross-sectional survey with comparisons by selection method, supported by a preregistered research design.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> An original online and mail survey of municipal clerks across five New England states conducted in Spring 2023.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study informs ongoing debates about electoral accountability and bureaucratic professionalism in local governance. It underscores how institutional design affects democratic responsiveness even in low-salience local offices.</p>',

'commissions': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Does the public prefer presidential action or delegation to commissions when it comes to addressing major policy issues?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> There is no significant difference in public approval between direct presidential action and delegation to a commission. The public also sees no difference in the perceived effectiveness of policies formed through these two avenues.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Four original survey experiments testing public reactions to different forms of presidential action across various issue areas.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Experimental data from four public opinion surveys fielded to test causal effects of institutional design on public approval.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> Challenges the notion that presidential commissions are perceived as more credible or effective. Suggests that presidents can use commissions to appear active without suffering public backlash for inaction.</p>',

'attachment': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> What explains the ideological differences between urban and rural residents, and how does attachment to place shape political attitudes?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Rural residents report higher levels of neighborhood attachment than urban residents. This variation in place attachment contributes significantly to ideological divides, with contentment predicting conservatism and dissatisfaction predicting liberalism.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The authors use survey data and a place-based theoretical framework to evaluate how place attachment and residential satisfaction relate to political ideology.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> National survey data capturing attitudes about place and politics, along with demographic and geographic information to compare rural and urban populations.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study provides a sociological explanation for geographic polarization, showing how emotional and social bonds to place inform political beliefs. This contributes to our understanding of the urban-rural divide in electoral politics.</p>',

'autos': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do the presence of auto workers and PAC contributions influence congressional support for the auto industry?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Legislators are more likely to support particularistic legislation benefiting the auto industry when their districts contain more auto workers, but this effect diminishes on broader or more ideologically contested legislation.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The authors analyze roll call votes on major auto-related bills and examine lobbying activity across over 250 pieces of legislation.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Roll call voting data, auto worker population statistics by congressional district, and lobbying records for bills of interest to the auto industry.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study highlights the electoral and representational incentives that shape economic policymaking. It shows that legislators respond not only to campaign contributions but to the concentrated presence of industry workers in their districts.</p>',

'bellwether': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do bellwether counties retain predictive value in U.S. presidential elections, and how stable are they over time?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> The number of reliable bellwether counties has declined significantly in the era of geographic polarization. Even counties with long records of picking winners have recently lost that predictive power.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Historical analysis of voting patterns in U.S. counties across multiple presidential elections, using several definitions of bellwether status.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> County-level presidential election returns from the 1930s through 2020.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> Challenges the media and popular narratives around bellwether counties by showing that past performance is not a strong predictor of future electoral outcomes. Highlights the effects of polarization and demographic sorting on electoral forecasting.</p>',

'blameclaim': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do executives’ presentational strategies during crises—blame claiming vs. blame deflecting—affect public support?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Executives who claim responsibility during a crisis are viewed more favorably than those who deflect blame. Blame claiming boosts perceptions of leadership and honesty, even when the crisis is negative.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A series of survey experiments using both stylized and real-world crisis scenarios to test the impact of different rhetorical strategies on public evaluations.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Experimental survey data exposing respondents to varied presentations of executive crisis response.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> Offers a counterintuitive insight that taking responsibility may be politically advantageous during crises. This contributes to our understanding of political communication, crisis management, and accountability.</p>',

'asking': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How stable are public attitudes toward unilateral presidential action, and how are they affected by contextual features such as the president’s identity, the tool used, and the issue at stake?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Public attitudes toward unilateral presidential power are surprisingly consistent and largely unaffected by contextual framing—except in explicitly political contexts. Even with different presidents or justifications, support for unilateral action remains low and stable.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A series of large-scale survey experiments testing how public support for unilateral action changes under different political and institutional scenarios.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> More than 7,500 responses across several experiments that vary the identity of the president, policy area, justification, and tool used (e.g., executive orders).</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> Challenges assumptions that public opinion is highly malleable in response to presidential framing. Shows that views on unilateral power are deeply held, shaping how we understand presidential legitimacy and public constraint on executive action.</p>',

'appearances': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Within swing states, do presidential candidates target supportive areas (“the base”) or expand outreach to peripheral, potentially persuadable counties?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> In 2008, McCain-Palin pursued a base strategy, campaigning in Republican strongholds, while Obama-Biden used a peripheral strategy focused on high-growth, less partisan counties. These choices reflect divergent campaign strategies with implications for electoral outreach.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Empirical analysis of county-level campaign appearance data during the 2008 general election.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Original dataset of all candidate appearances in 2008, linked to county demographics, past vote margins, and population changes.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> Offers a rare look inside campaign decision-making within battleground states. Reveals how geography and demography interact in presidential campaign strategy, and why campaigns might ignore swing areas in favor of predictable partisan terrain.</p>',

'environment': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How does vulnerability to sea-level rise shape public opinion toward climate change policy?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> People who live in coastal communities vulnerable to sea-level rise are more likely to support climate mitigation policies, particularly if they are deeply rooted in their communities. The effect is not strongest among those with the most to lose financially, but among those most tied to place.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The study uses a multi-method empirical approach combining large-scale survey data with precinct-level voting returns on climate-related propositions.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Hundreds of thousands of survey responses and nearly 30,000 precinct-level voting returns, matched with local vulnerability to sea-level rise.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The findings suggest that direct exposure to climate threats can overcome partisan divides and build support for policy change. It underscores how community-rooted vulnerability—not just ideology or partisanship—shapes public opinion about climate change.</p>',

'fema': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do presidents use unilateral authority over disaster declarations to pursue electoral advantage?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents are significantly more likely to issue disaster declarations to competitive states. These actions bring electoral rewards: a single declaration can yield more than a one-point gain in statewide vote share.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Quantitative analysis of disaster declarations across U.S. states from 1981 to 2004, before and after the expansion of presidential authority via the 1988 Stafford Act.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Archival data on presidential disaster declarations matched with electoral competitiveness and presidential vote returns.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This paper illuminates how presidents exploit unilateral powers not only for policy but also for electoral gain. It adds to broader debates about the strategic use of institutional authority and the politicization of emergency management.</p>',

'foreclosures': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do local economic conditions shape public perceptions of the national economy?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Local economic indicators—especially foreclosures, unemployment, and gas prices—significantly influence how political independents evaluate national economic performance. These effects are particularly strong among less partisan and less politically informed voters.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from the 2008 presidential election, matched with geographically specific economic indicators.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Public opinion data merged with county- and ZIP-level statistics on unemployment, foreclosures, and fuel prices.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study challenges the assumption that national economic evaluations are purely sociotropic or partisan. It highlights how geographic context—what the authors term "geotropic considerations"—influences political judgment and behavior.</p>',

'constraints': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do legal and political constraints shape the use of unilateral executive power by U.S. presidents?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Legal and political constraints significantly reduce the likelihood that presidents will act unilaterally. Presidents are more likely to issue executive orders when courts and Congress are less likely to oppose them, indicating that constraints are binding, not merely symbolic.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The study employs formal theory and an empirical analysis of unilateral executive orders from 1945 to 2012, evaluating when and why presidents choose to act without Congress.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Archival data on executive orders, legislative gridlock indicators, judicial context, and interbranch conflict.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The paper challenges the idea that presidents can act unilaterally at will. It shows how institutional design and interbranch relationships limit executive power, deepening our understanding of the presidency and separation of powers.</p>',

'context': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How does the political context shape public evaluations of presidential power and the use of executive orders?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Public support for executive orders depends heavily on partisan alignment. When presidents use unilateral tools, co-partisans reward them and out-partisans punish them—regardless of the issue or justification.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Survey experiments varying the identity of the president, the issue area, and the type of justification given for an executive order.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Experimental data from large national surveys examining public reaction to hypothetical uses of executive power.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This study shows how partisan polarization shapes not only elite behavior but also mass attitudes toward executive power. It reveals a key mechanism behind the erosion of consensus on constitutional norms.</p>',

'crime': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do local crime rates affect public support for policing, punishment, and criminal justice reform?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Local crime rates influence public opinion in complex ways. Higher violent crime correlates with greater support for punitive measures, but people’s personal experience and political predispositions shape how they interpret crime trends.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Cross-sectional survey combined with geographic data on local crime rates, testing how objective conditions relate to subjective attitudes.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> National survey data linked to local-level crime statistics and demographic variables.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study informs debates about the politics of policing and punishment by showing how geographic context conditions public opinion. It underscores the importance of both place-based and psychological mechanisms in shaping views on criminal justice.</p>',

'crisis': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do presidents use unilateral executive tools during national crises, and how does crisis influence their likelihood of acting alone?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents are more likely to act unilaterally during national crises, especially when the public demands swift action and institutional constraints are relaxed. The likelihood of unilateral action increases in response to crises in both foreign and domestic policy domains.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Theoretical modeling combined with empirical analysis of unilateral presidential actions from 1945 to 2006, including executive orders and other directives.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Historical data on presidential directives and crises, categorized by type and severity, along with institutional control variables.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This paper contributes to our understanding of how emergency conditions alter the balance of power in American government. It raises important normative questions about democratic accountability during times of crisis.</p>',

'disasters-review': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> What does existing research say about how natural disasters affect political behavior and government accountability?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Citizens tend to reward incumbents for disaster relief spending and punish them for slow or ineffective responses, regardless of actual preparedness. Disasters also exacerbate inequalities in political attention and resource allocation.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A synthetic review of empirical studies and theoretical frameworks from political science and public administration concerning disaster politics.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> The paper draws on dozens of published studies using survey data, disaster declarations, electoral outcomes, and case analyses.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This review integrates fragmented research to clarify how natural disasters shape democratic accountability. It highlights persistent challenges in achieving equity and responsiveness in disaster policy.</p>',

'electoralcollege': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How does the Electoral College shape presidential campaign strategies and voter representation?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> The Electoral College incentivizes campaigns to focus disproportionately on swing states and overlook safe states, leading to unequal representation and resource allocation. The system magnifies the influence of a small number of voters in competitive areas.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Empirical analysis of campaign appearances, spending, and media coverage during recent presidential elections, combined with simulation models of counterfactual election outcomes.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Data on campaign activity from the 2000 through 2012 elections, including candidate visits and advertising, along with national vote totals.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study underscores the democratic deficits of the Electoral College, particularly in terms of unequal influence and participation. It informs ongoing debates about electoral reform and the structure of American presidential elections.</p>',

'political-geography': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do geographic factors and spatial context shape public opinion and political behavior?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Geographic context systematically influences political attitudes and behaviors, beyond individual traits. Local composition, proximity to others, and community characteristics are central to understanding public opinion and electoral outcomes.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> This is a synthetic review essay that integrates findings from political science, sociology, and geography to evaluate how place affects politics.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> The paper synthesizes empirical work using survey data, spatial analysis, and multilevel models across various studies of political behavior and geography.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This work highlights how political inequality is shaped not just by who people are, but where they live. It provides a framework for understanding polarization, representation, and spatial segregation in American politics.</p>',

'partpres': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do presidents act as national representatives or pursue particularistic strategies that benefit specific political constituencies?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents systematically direct federal resources to politically valuable constituencies, rather than distributing benefits equitably. This pattern reflects strategic behavior aimed at securing reelection and partisan advantage.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The authors present a comprehensive theoretical framework of presidential particularism, supported by empirical studies on federal grant allocation and disaster declarations.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Multiple datasets on federal spending, disaster aid, and electoral outcomes are drawn from prior work to support the central claims.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The paper reorients how we think about presidential governance, suggesting that the executive office contributes to political inequality. It has major implications for democratic accountability and the theory of national representation.</p>',

'pasachoff-reply': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> What are the broader implications of presidential particularism, and how does it relate to populism and executive branch governance?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> The authors defend and extend their theory of presidential particularism in response to critique. They argue that particularistic policymaking is a persistent and central feature of executive governance, not a marginal or exceptional behavior.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> This is a conceptual reply that synthesizes normative and empirical arguments, responding to legal scholarship and expanding the theoretical implications of prior findings.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> The paper draws on previously published empirical studies of presidential behavior, federal spending, and administrative discretion.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The reply sharpens the normative critique of presidential governance and stresses how particularism can undermine equal protection and public trust. It contributes to interdisciplinary debates on executive power and the rule of law.</p>',

'geolocation': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can geolocation data be used to improve survey research in political science?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Incorporating geolocation data allows researchers to connect individual survey responses to detailed information about respondents’ communities. This linkage reveals that local context significantly shapes political attitudes, especially on issues like immigration and economic policy.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The paper demonstrates a novel research design that combines geolocation-enabled survey responses with external geographic data on demographics, economic conditions, and policy environments.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> A series of large-scale surveys collected via smartphone, which include GPS coordinates, linked to administrative and census-based geographic datasets.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This approach enables a richer understanding of how place influences political preferences and opens new avenues for integrating behavioral data with spatial analysis in public opinion research.</p>',

'guardians': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do bureaucratic officials responsible for election administration perceive their role in maintaining electoral integrity and democratic norms?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Local election officials often see themselves as nonpartisan “guardians of democracy,” emphasizing neutrality, rule-following, and voter access. These professional identities help buffer election administration from partisan pressure.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews with local election officials across multiple states.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Dozens of structured interviews with county and municipal election officials, supplemented by content analysis of official communications and training materials.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The paper sheds light on how street-level bureaucrats in the electoral system think about their responsibilities, offering a hopeful counterpoint to concerns about partisan capture of election administration.</p>',

'healthcare': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do voters respond to policy changes in Medicaid, particularly in terms of political accountability for governors?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Governors receive credit or blame for Medicaid expansion decisions. Voters in states that expanded Medicaid were more likely to support incumbent governors, especially when they perceived personal or community benefits.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Difference-in-differences analysis comparing political attitudes and electoral outcomes in Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states before and after policy changes.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Public opinion surveys and gubernatorial election results, matched with state-level Medicaid expansion decisions and health coverage statistics.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The paper illustrates how major public policy changes translate into electoral accountability, even for policies that are complex and administered at multiple levels of government.</p>',

'jobs': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do constituents respond to presidential efforts to claim credit for local economic gains, particularly job creation?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents often try to take credit for new jobs, but their success depends on partisan alignment and media coverage. Co-partisans are more likely to believe presidential claims, while out-partisans are skeptical or unaffected.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Survey experiments testing how voters react to job-related presidential credit-claiming messages under varying partisan and economic conditions.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Nationally representative survey experiments embedded in online panels, paired with local economic indicators and presidential messaging cues.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study helps explain the limits of presidential influence on public perceptions of the economy, highlighting how partisanship mediates credit and blame in the political information environment.</p>',

'leap': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do public attitudes about government spending on disaster relief change depending on whether the aid is framed as targeted or universal?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> People are more supportive of disaster aid when it is framed as universal and not targeted toward specific groups. This reflects a general preference for broad-based government programs over particularistic ones.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Survey experiments that vary how disaster relief spending is described and identify how framing affects public support.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Original nationally representative survey experiments with randomized framing of disaster aid policy scenarios.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The findings offer insights into how public opinion can constrain or enable government responsiveness to crises, depending on perceptions of fairness and distributional equity.</p>',

'lines': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do polling place lines affect voter experience, confidence, and trust in the electoral process?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Long lines at polling places reduce voter confidence in the fairness and efficiency of elections. These effects are strongest among voters who experience delays and among historically marginalized groups.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Original survey research assessing voter experiences with polling lines and their relationship to confidence in the electoral process.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Post-election surveys capturing self-reported wait times, demographic information, and evaluations of election administration.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study demonstrates how seemingly minor administrative barriers like wait times can erode trust in democratic institutions. It provides evidence for reforms aimed at improving access and equity in election administration.</p>',

'nothing': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do presidents receive electoral rewards for successful policy achievements, or does good governance often go unnoticed?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents frequently receive little or no electoral benefit from policy successes, especially when those policies are complex or lack visibility. Voters often fail to connect improved outcomes with presidential action.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A combination of case studies and empirical analysis examining whether measurable policy achievements lead to changes in presidential approval or vote share.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Case-specific political data, including public opinion trends and electoral results, linked to major policy actions across multiple administrations.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This paper challenges assumptions about democratic accountability, suggesting that political incentives may not align with effective governance. It raises important questions about how and whether voters reward competence.</p>',

'spending': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do voters reward presidents for increased federal spending in their communities?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Yes. Voters are more likely to support incumbent presidents (or their party’s nominee) when federal spending in their counties increases. The effect is strongest in battleground states and among liberal and moderate voters, especially when congressional co-partisanship clarifies partisan responsibility.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A county- and individual-level analysis of presidential elections from 1988 to 2008, testing whether increases in federal spending lead to electoral rewards for presidents.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> County-level federal grant data linked to electoral returns, as well as individual-level survey data from the 2008 election, allowing for ideological conditioning.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The findings suggest that, contrary to claims that voters favor fiscal restraint, federal largesse is electorally beneficial for presidents. This work shifts the scholarly focus from congressional pork to presidential credit-claiming for distributive politics.</p>',

'targeting': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do presidents allocate federal funds in a universalistic manner to benefit the nation as a whole, or do they target politically strategic constituencies?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents act particularistically, directing disproportionate federal resources to counties in swing states and to core partisan constituencies, especially during reelection campaigns. They prioritize electoral advantage over national interest.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> County-level statistical analysis of federal spending from 1984 to 2008, with attention to political characteristics of recipient areas and electoral cycles.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Federal budget allocation data matched to electoral returns and county characteristics, with models distinguishing between core, swing, and opposition areas.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This study refutes the normative image of presidents as universalistic national leaders. It demonstrates systematic political favoritism in budget allocations, raising important concerns about equity, accountability, and the role of electoral incentives in federal governance.</p>',

'popularity': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> What drives fluctuations in presidential approval, and how do events, the economy, and partisan dynamics shape public evaluations of presidents?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidential approval is sensitive to short-term events like scandals and crises, as well as economic performance. Over time, however, partisan polarization has become the dominant force, limiting the impact of events and reinforcing stable, partisan divides in approval ratings.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A comprehensive review of empirical literature on the determinants of presidential approval, supplemented by new data visualizations of trends from the Eisenhower to Trump administrations.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Aggregated presidential approval data from Gallup and other national polling organizations, linked to economic indicators, political events, and time series models.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This work synthesizes decades of research to show how the American public evaluates its presidents and how that process has changed in the age of polarization. It offers a critical context for understanding contemporary governance and democratic accountability.</p>',

'prespart': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do presidents reflect national interests in distributing federal aid, or do they favor their partisan base?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents disproportionately direct federal aid to counties with co-partisan governors, particularly during election years. This pattern holds across both Democratic and Republican administrations, suggesting a systematic partisan logic in executive resource allocation.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Panel regression models of county-level FEMA disaster aid from 1996 to 2011, with interaction terms capturing the presence of co-partisan governors and electoral timing.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> FEMA public assistance records, gubernatorial partisanship data, county-level political and demographic controls, and presidential election timing.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The findings reveal a hidden form of executive particularism that operates through federal-state cooperation. They suggest presidents use intergovernmental tools to serve political ends, raising concerns about the politicization of emergency management.</p>',

'prespower': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> What constrains or enables presidential unilateral action, and how do institutions and public opinion influence executive policymaking?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents are more likely to act unilaterally when public support is high and when institutional checks—such as congressional opposition—are weak or fragmented. The study finds that political conditions, not legal constraints, are the dominant factors in presidential decision-making.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A formal theoretical model of executive action combined with empirical testing using time-series cross-sectional data on unilateral orders.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Executive orders and proclamations from 1945 to 2006, linked with measures of public approval, congressional composition, and political polarization.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The paper helps reframe debates over executive power by emphasizing political incentives and constraints. It contributes to broader discussions about democratic accountability and the strategic nature of presidential governance.</p>',

'rain': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do voters reward or punish presidents for natural disasters, and does the distribution of federal disaster aid affect electoral outcomes?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Presidents gain electoral support in counties that receive disaster declarations and federal assistance, but only when the response is timely and well-publicized. Voters appear to reward presidents for responsiveness, not just for objective conditions.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> County-level analysis of presidential elections from 1988 to 2004, using event-study designs to isolate the effects of disaster aid on vote share.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> FEMA disaster declaration records, county-level presidential vote returns, and timing of federal relief announcements.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This study shows how electoral accountability can function even in the face of uncontrollable events. It also demonstrates how presidents use disasters to enhance their reelection prospects through visible governance.</p>',

'reassessment-long': '<p><b>Research Question:</b> How should we assess the effectiveness of the American presidency, and what metrics capture success beyond short-term approval or policy wins?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> The authors argue for a broader reassessment of presidential effectiveness that includes institutional leadership, long-term policy change, and normative considerations. They caution against over-reliance on popularity or legislative tallies as measures of presidential success.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> A conceptual and historical reassessment drawing on presidential case studies and existing theories of executive leadership.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Historical case examples from multiple presidencies, used illustratively to support normative and institutional arguments.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This work encourages scholars and citizens to evaluate presidents in terms of democratic values, institutional stewardship, and enduring impact—not just short-term wins. It reframes how presidential greatness and failure are understood.</p>',
