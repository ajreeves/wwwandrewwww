The likelihood of unilateral action increases in response to crises in both foreign and domestic policy domains.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> Theoretical modeling combined with empirical analysis of unilateral presidential actions from 1945 to 2006, including executive orders and other directives.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Historical data on presidential directives and crises, categorized by type and severity, along with institutional control variables.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This paper contributes to our understanding of how emergency conditions alter the balance of power in American government. It raises important normative questions about democratic accountability during times of crisis.</p>},

	summary = {<p><b>Research Question:</b> How accurate are different vote tabulation methods, and do modern voting machines improve accuracy compared to traditional hand-counted paper ballots?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Optical scanning machines demonstrate superior accuracy compared to hand-counted paper ballots. The tabulation error rate for optically scanned ballots was approximately 0.56%, compared to 0.87% for hand-counted paper ballots (excluding outliers). This represents roughly a 50% improvement in tabulation accuracy with machine counting.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The study employs a "tabulation validation rate" methodology, comparing initial vote counts with recount results to measure accuracy. The analysis includes both historical data (1946-1962) to establish baselines for hand counting, and contemporary data (2002) to compare hand counting with optical scanning technology. Regression analysis controls for office type, community size, and initial vote totals.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Historical recount data from New Hampshire elections spanning 1946-2002, including 415 cases from the historical period (all hand-counted) and 306 cases from 2002 (comparing hand-counted vs. optically scanned ballots). The dataset covers various offices from local races to Congressional contests across multiple New Hampshire towns and districts.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> This research provides empirical evidence that voting technology modernization has indeed improved election accuracy, contrary to concerns raised after the 2000 Florida recount. The findings have direct implications for election administration policy, suggesting that automatic recount thresholds should consider technology-specific error rates and that continued investment in optical scanning technology is justified by measurable improvements in vote tabulation accuracy.</p>},

The effect is not strongest among those with the most to lose financially, but among those most tied to place.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The study uses a multi-method empirical approach combining large-scale survey data with precinct-level voting returns on climate-related propositions.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Hundreds of thousands of survey responses and nearly 30,000 precinct-level voting returns, matched with local vulnerability to sea-level rise.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The findings suggest that direct exposure to climate threats can overcome partisan divides and build support for policy change. It underscores how community-rooted vulnerability---not just ideology or partisanship---shapes public opinion about climate change.</p>},

	summary = {<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do polling place conditions vary across jurisdictions, and what factors account for this variation?</p> <p><b>Main Finding:</b> Polling places across the United States in the 2016 election generally exhibited high quality. Variation in polling place access, facilities, and practices was largely a function of county and state-level factors, not voter demographics.</p> <p><b>Research Design:</b> The study used a multi-jurisdictional field assessment of polling places across 26 jurisdictions in 17 states, combining observational data and administrative records.</p> <p><b>Data Employed:</b> Data come from in-person evaluations and administrative data collected during the 2016 presidential election. The study builds on prior localized research but scales up to a national analysis.</p> <p><b>Substantive Importance:</b> The study provides critical evidence that challenges prior findings of systemic disparities in polling place quality along racial or socioeconomic lines, suggesting institutional rather than demographic sources of variation. This has implications for election policy and equity in access to the vote.</p>},
