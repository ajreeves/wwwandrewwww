abstract: |
  I argue that presidents use unilateral powers for particularistic aims to gain electoral support. Specifically, I examine presidential disaster declarations, which allow presidents to unilaterally authorize potentially billions of dollars to specific constituencies. In an analysis extending from 1981 to 2004, I find that a state's electoral competitiveness influences whether they receive a disaster declaration from the president. A highly competitive state can expect to receive twice as many presidential disaster declarations as an uncompetitive state. This relationship has existed since the passage of the 1988 Stafford Act, which expanded the disaster declaration powers of the president. Additionally, I find that these decisions have the intended electoral benefits‚Äîvoters react and reward presidents for presidential disaster declarations. A president can expect over a one point increase in a statewide contest in return for a single presidential disaster declaration.

## Research Question

Do presidents use unilateral authority over disaster declarations to pursue electoral advantage?

## Main Finding

Presidents are significantly more likely to issue disaster declarations to competitive states. These actions bring electoral rewards: a single declaration can yield more than a one-point gain in statewide vote share.

## Research Design

Quantitative analysis of disaster declarations across U.S. states from 1981 to 2004, before and after the expansion of presidential authority via the 1988 Stafford Act.

## Data Employed

Archival data on presidential disaster declarations matched with electoral competitiveness and presidential vote returns.

## Substantive Importance

This paper illuminates how presidents exploit unilateral powers not only for policy but also for electoral gain. It adds to broader debates about the strategic use of institutional authority and the politicization of emergency management.
