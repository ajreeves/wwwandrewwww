This includes tools like executive orders, emergency declarations, and disaster relief.

Rogowski](https://voices.uchicago.edu/jrogowski/), investigates how Americans think about executive authority.\n\nReeves and Rogowski explore how Americans think about presidential authority, finding that many citizens are skeptical of unilateral executive action—even when undertaken by presidents they support. The book combines historical analysis, survey experiments, and public opinion data to show that concerns about constitutional limits and democratic norms shape public evaluations of presidential power.

Drawing on data from disaster declarations, defense spending, and federal grants, the authors demonstrate that presidents engage in a form of \"particularism\" similar to the parochial behavior commonly attributed to Congress.
