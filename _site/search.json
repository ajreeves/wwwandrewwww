    "text": "Teaching Philosophy\nMy courses emphasize the practical application of political science theory to understand contemporary American politics. I strive to help students develop critical thinking skills by examining how institutions, incentives, and individual behavior shape political outcomes. Through case studies, data analysis, and discussion of current events, students learn to connect academic research to real-world political phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\nIntroduction to American Politics\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of American government and politics\n\n\n\n\nThe Biden presidency concludes amidst international turmoil, the fallout from a global pandemic, and increasing economic dissatisfaction among Americans. American institutions are being tested by a polarized political environment, regular mass protests, and are still adjusting from the former and possibly next president, who challenged many political norms. We will explore how we got here and consider the future of American politics.\n\nThe first part of the class deals with the institutional building blocks of the American political system. After we discuss the principles of political science, we'll discuss the operation and evolution of the legislative, judicial, and executive branches. In the second part of the class, we'll consider the things that happen just outside the purview of the U.S. Constitution, like public opinion, the media, elections, political parties, and interest groups.\n\n\n\nKey Topics\n\nConstitutional foundations and federalism\nExecutive, legislative, and judicial branches\nPolitical parties and interest groups\nElections and voting behavior\nPublic opinion and media\nCivil rights and civil liberties\n\n\n\n\nSyllabus (Fall 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\nBusiness of Elections\nUnderstanding presidential elections through the prism of business and political science\n\n\n\n\nThis course examines presidential elections as complex enterprises that combine political strategy, data analytics, fundraising, and marketing. Students explore how campaigns are organized, funded, and executed, drawing parallels between campaign management and business operations. We analyze voter targeting, message development, coalition building, and the role of money in modern campaigns.\n\nThe course bridges political science theory with practical campaign mechanics, helping students understand both the democratic process and the professional skills involved in running competitive elections.\n\n\n\nKey Topics\n\nCampaign strategy and organization\nPolitical fundraising and finance\nVoter targeting and data analytics\nMedia strategy and advertising\nCoalition building and mobilization\nElectoral systems and competition\n\n\n\n\nCourse Materials"

    "text": "My Research\nMy research explores the American presidency, the geography of political life, how voters hold leaders accountable, and how public resources are distributed. I study these questions using a range of data‚Äîfrom surveys and election returns to federal spending and disaster aid‚Äîto better understand the functioning of American democracy. My recent book, No Blank Check, examines how public attitudes shape and constrain presidential power, even in moments of national crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidential Power and Public Constraint\n\n\nI study how presidents lead, especially when they act without Congress. This includes tools like executive orders, emergency declarations, and disaster relief. While presidents often pursue these actions to advance policy or gain political advantage, they are not free to act without consequences. In No Blank Check, I show that the public has clear and often skeptical views about presidential power. Americans may support strong leadership in theory, but in practice they are quick to oppose presidents who act too aggressively or appear self-serving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeography and Political Experience\n\n\nWhere people live shapes their political views and the kind of government they receive. My work shows that voters in urban, suburban, and rural communities experience democracy differently‚Äîfrom how they vote to how they are served by federal programs. I explore how geography influences partisanship, perceptions of fairness, and trust in institutions. These spatial divides are central to understanding today‚Äôs political polarization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoter Behavior and Political Accountability\n\n\nMuch of my research asks whether voters reward leaders for good governance or punish them for poor performance. The answer often depends on timing, visibility, and proximity. Voters are responsive when federal aid arrives quickly or when local unemployment improves, but they are less likely to notice longer-term or complex policies. This disconnect explains why some presidents prioritize short-term gains over durable policy change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributive Politics and Federal Power\n\n\nPresidents and other national leaders have broad discretion in how they allocate federal dollars. I examine how political motivations‚Äîsuch as targeting swing states or rewarding co-partisans‚Äîinfluence the flow of resources. From disaster relief to infrastructure spending, my work shows how electoral incentives shape decisions that affect millions of Americans. This has serious implications for equity and public trust in government."

    "text": "Books\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Blank Check: The Origins and Consequences of Public Antipathy toward Presidential Power (Cambridge University Press, 2022), with Jon C. Rogowski, investigates how Americans think about executive authority.\nReeves and Rogowski explore how Americans think about presidential authority, finding that many citizens are skeptical of unilateral executive action‚Äîeven when undertaken by presidents they support. The book combines historical analysis, survey experiments, and public opinion data to show that concerns about constitutional limits and democratic norms shape public evaluations of presidential power. This resistance to expansive executive authority suggests that the public can act as a meaningful check on the presidency, even in a polarized era.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Particularistic President: Executive Branch Politics and Political Inequality (Cambridge University Press), coauthored with Douglas Kriner, received the 2016 Richard E. Neustadt Award from the American Political Science Association.\nKriner and Reeves challenges the widespread belief that presidents act in the national interest, showing instead that they often favor specific constituencies‚Äîespecially swing states and partisan allies‚Äîwhen distributing federal resources. Drawing on data from disaster declarations, defense spending, and federal grants, the authors demonstrate that presidents engage in a form of ‚Äúparticularism‚Äù similar to the parochial behavior commonly attributed to Congress. The book warns that increasing presidential power may not counteract legislative dysfunction but instead deepen political inequality through executive favoritism."

Instead, support for presidential power is conditional‚Äì-shaped by partisanship, trust in government, the policy domain, and the political context. Even partisans often resist expansions of power when used in disfavored ways, suggesting the presence of principled constraints in public opinion."
