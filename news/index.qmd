### Trump treats laws as obstacles, not limits − and the only real check on his rule-breaking can come from political pressure

**[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/trump-treats-laws-as-obstacles-not-limits-and-the-only-real-check-on-his-rule-breaking-can-come-from-political-pressure-255834)** • May 21, 2025

Legal boundaries are often treated by Trump's administration as optional. The most meaningful check on presidential power will be political—courts rely on the broader political system for enforcement through elected officials, Congress, bureaucrats, and public pressure.

### Biden and Trump will talk big at the debate, but how much could either really do?

**[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-06-25/biden-trump-debate-presidential-campaign)** • June 25, 2024

Despite campaign promises, presidents face significant constraints on their ability to deliver policy change. The institutional presidency, partisan gridlock, and federalism all limit executive power in ways voters often don't appreciate.

### Biden's Supreme Court commission probably won't sway public opinion

**[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/bidens-supreme-court-commission-probably-wont-sway-public-opinion-159658)** • June 16, 2021

Presidential commissions rarely change public opinion on contentious issues. The Supreme Court commission faces the challenge that Americans' views on court reform are already deeply entrenched along partisan lines, making persuasion difficult.

### This pandemic is a test for leaders. Voters do the grading

**[Saint Louis Post-Dispatch](https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/andrew-reeves-this-pandemic-is-a-test-for-leaders-voters-do-the-grading/article_80a024d0-8128-5d4a-809a-122d594e517a.html)** • April 1, 2020

Natural disasters and crises create accountability moments for elected officials. How leaders respond—and how voters perceive that response—can reshape electoral fortunes and political careers.

### Donald Trump's lukewarm response to Puerto Rico was pretty predictable. Here's why

**[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/10/02/puerto-rican-residents-dont-vote-for-president-or-congress-could-that-affect-trumps-response-to-hurricane-maria/)** • October 2, 2017

Electoral incentives shape disaster response. When affected populations can't vote for federal officials, we see predictably different patterns in aid allocation and presidential attention.

### Florida Disaster Aid Can Help Bush

**Los Angeles Times** • October 3, 2004

Research shows that electoral importance of a state plays a large role in determining whether a president declares a disaster. A non-battleground state with three electoral votes is almost 50% less likely to receive a disaster declaration than a battleground state with 20 or more electoral votes.

### Plucking Votes From Disasters

**Los Angeles Times** • May 12, 2004

A battleground state with 20 electoral votes receives about 50% more disaster declarations than a state with three electoral votes that is not considered crucial for victory, even after accounting for need. Electoral motivations have dramatic effects on disaster policy.
